# User-Authentication-using-Keystroke-Data
Authenticate the user by training and testing One Class Support Vector Machine classifier by keystroke dynamics of the neutral, happy and sad mood data.   
In  addition,  keystroke  dynamics  is  one  of  the  most  efficient  and  inexpensive              
behavioral  biometrics  that  can  be  used  to  authenticate  a  user.  So  SVM  ,  along                
with  keystroke  dynamics  can  be  utilized  as  the  classification  engine  of  users              
with   high   efficacy   due   to   its   high   recognition   rate   and   efficient   processing.
